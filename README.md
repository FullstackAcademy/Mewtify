# Mewtify
Malware Mutation brought to you by Cephamist and jzheng6182  
This program was built to bring awareness to our over reliance on anti-virus. This program is built so that any script kiddie can slip a malicious python-coded payload passed any antivirus.  

Requirements:  
- Python3 to be installed on both self and target computers.
- One malicious malware

How it operates:  
1- Obtain a malicious python file. (This will work only for python files)  
2- Open up Mewtify  
3- Select the python file and input the name of your payload.  
4- Press Mewtify and a malicious file should be created in the same folder.
5- This malware should bypass any antivirus scans (to confirm run it on Virus Total). It is also capable of running itself on target computers.
