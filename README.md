# **Mewtify**
*Malware Mutation brought to you by Cephamist and jzheng6182*  
This program was built to bring awareness to our over reliance on anti-virus. This program is built so that any script kiddie can slip a malicious python-coded payload passed any antivirus.  

**Requirements:**  
- Python3 to be installed on both self and target computers.
- One malicious malware  
- pyaes has to be imported 
  
**Features:**  
- Python mutation available for windows and linux
- JPEG mutation availlable for windows
  
**How it operates:**  
1- Select a mutation you want to run.  
2- Obtain a malicious python file. (This will work only for python files)  
3- Open up Mewtify  
4- Select the python file and input the name of your payload.  
5- Press Mewtify and a malicious file should be created in the same folder once the Mewtify button is purple again.  
6- This malware should bypass any antivirus scans (to confirm run it on Virus Total). It is also capable of running itself on target computers.
